/*LOWDOWN FOR FURTURE TOM: The main menu needs some tweaking to get it to work properly but for the most part
it works, once you've finished the character creator and created all the stats and imported them to the
newcharacter function etc etc, 
create a new file for the actual game, this file I'm intending to only be for the menu
and character creation, you need to create the player's file and then load it into the second cpp file
for the actual game and commence from there*/
